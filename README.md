# BostonHacks Website Templates	
### Backstory
Back in March, we as the [BostonHacks](https://bostonhacks.io/) team began throwing around ideas for website themes. While we eventually settled on a different look, here are two designs I put together. 

### Pre-Release Theme ("One Pager")
I wanted to create a look very similar to those of the large "iconic" Hackathons across the nation. Specifically, I really liked HackMIT's look (thus, it is relatively similar). Here's a preview. Click it to see  the site yourself!

P.S. Refresh the page! The background is dynamic :)

### Classic Homepage ("First Draft")
On the weekend of the Boston Marathon, between cheering on runners, I tried to pump out a simple site in 3 hours. Despite using a theme, making it our own was a lot of fun (especially configuring the Google Maps API) ! Again, click the preview to check it out.
